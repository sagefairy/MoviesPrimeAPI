My API is called Movies Prime and it allows access to data from the movie and actors database. Information such as movie names, description, genre, and cast information.
This API makes use of the CRUD operations for both the movies and actors.
To run the API, you run the visual studio file. it shows the swagger ui tab in your browser. All Get,Post,Put,Delete operations can be tested and executed with your own appropriate values where needed.

GET - gets all movies in the database 
GET{id} - gets the movie with that id 
POST - posts / creates a new record in the movie database
PUT{id} - updates an existing record in the movie database
DELETE - Deletes a record in the movie database
